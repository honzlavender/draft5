      <h3>Nice to meet you! I'm Honz ðŸ¤ </h3>
      <hr>
      <br>
       <p>I'm an experienced illustrator and *new* software developer based in Brooklyn.</p>
      <p>There are plenty of career opportunities in the world of coding but I'm hoping my skills will lead me to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>work with other creatives
        <li>develop websites for filmmakers, musicians, artists, and other makers
        <li>expand the accessibility of sex education and body positivity
        <li>and! debunk stigmas surrounding mental health and illnesses</li>
      </ul>
        <p>If I can surround myself with like-minded people who are working for the greater good while finding stability and pride in a company - I'll be more than satisfied. </p>

    <h3>About Me</h3>
      <p>My pronouns are she/they, I am artistic, I am queer, I am creative, and I am here to code.</p>
        <p>Admittedly I never saw myself as an engineer. The word in itself is very intimidating. I thought I'd be a starving artist forever. But as the world gets more digital, so does art!</p>
          <p>Code is just another medium for me to express myself. Over the years, I've learned that I thrive in creative environments and collaborating with others. Working alone is limiting and lonely. I enjoy bringing others' ideas to life with my unique perspective.</p>
